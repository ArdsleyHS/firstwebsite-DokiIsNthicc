                    <h3><b>SCARRA</b></h3>
                        <p>Scarra is a tft streamer, TFT stands for Team Fight Tactics. 
                    <br>
                            I've recently been trying to get into this game but apperantly I do not understand how synergies work, and which items work best on each class.
                            Overall, Scarra is someone I'd watch when doing homework or while im in a voice call
                        </p>

                    <h3><b>Michael Reeves</b></h3>
                        <p>Now, You see, This particular man is a very curious specimen</p>
